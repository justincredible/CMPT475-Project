1. Safety Requirements
    1.1 In a system with 0 processes, no machine or token is black. no machine should be in active state.
    1.2 In a system with 0 processes, Supervisor machine should only need to instantiate the algorithm exactly once
    1.3 If a process has 100% chance sending a message, the process cannot terminate.
    1.4 Process cannot forward token to machines with equal or lower index
        1.4.1 With the exception that N-1 machine can send to supervisor machine

2. Liveness Requirements
    1.1 Token is returned to the supervisor machine
