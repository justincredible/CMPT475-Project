1. Safety Requirements
    1.1 In a system with 0 processes, no machine or token is black. no machine should be in active state.
    1.2 In a system with 0 processes, Supervisor machine should only need to instantiate the algorithm exactly once
    1.3 If a process has 100% chance sending a message, the process cannot terminate.

2. Liveness Requirements
    2.1 Token is returned to the supervisor machine

the tester agent program would execute all these rules in parallel:
1.1, 1.2 if size(PROCESS) = 0 then
			skip
1.3 if not sends < 1 then
		if exists p in PROCESS with reported(p) = true then
			print "requirement 1.3 not met."
2.1 forall p in PROCESS do
		{
		if token(machine_0,p) = undef then
			if forall m in MACHINE holds m != machine_0 and token(m,p) = undef then
				print "requirement 2.1 not met."
		if forall m in MACHINE holds m = machine_0 or Active(m,p) = false then
			if token(machine_0,p) = undef then
				print "requirement 2.1 not met."
		}
