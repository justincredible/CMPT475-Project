Dijkstra et al. have proved the algorithm works for one process, and adding a procotol identifier to the functions and rules should not affect the execution of the protocol.
If we use process numbers as protocol identifiers, then our algorithm can be viewed as running individual instances of the protocol concurrently.
Since Dijkstra et al.'s algorithm works for one protocol and one protocol instance does not create changes in the other protocol instances, our algorith works.
